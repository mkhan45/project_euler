I had a wheel factorization function for Python laying around somewhere so I just used that. In Haskell the implementation is super cool. It's essentially generating a pseudo prime number sieve similarly to how I made the infinite even fibonacci number list.

I didn't do this in Rust because it'd be basically the same as Python.
