# Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

In all languages, I used a lazy infinite list of the even fibonacci numbers. In Python this was done via a generator, in Rust via an iterator, and in Haskell via a lazy infinite list.
